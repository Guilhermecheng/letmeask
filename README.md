# Letmeask

Study project made with Rocketseat's NLW. 

### The project

Letmeask is a real time Q&A platform, with the intention to help streamers answering your public by a simple, easy to use app.

Its real intent is to be a case study for learning how react apps work, and integrating projects with firebase auth and firebase realtime database.
